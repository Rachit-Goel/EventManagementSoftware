# EventManagementSoftware
This Event Management Software is designed to help employees like Event Managers /Event
Organizers, Staff managers, etc in an event planning company to manage their work related to events efficiently.  
If there are many events like weddings, conferences, seminars being conducted on different venues on
the same date then it will be difficult to manage this situation manually. So this system will help in
keeping the record of events, their date and venue, etc., at some online database server.  
Also which staff member is allotted to which
event and keep track of different technical and non-technical requirements needed during an event.
This will thus increase productivity and efficiency.  
This software can be used by many others apart from the event manager or organizer. This
may include a person who is in charge of managing the staff. This software is also helpful for
managing the catering service.  
Users who are authorized by the admin and having the user id and password can use this software.  
To store the database of EMS, we have used Amazon RDS for MySQL by Amazon Web
Services(AWS) which is hosted on an online server, so that each user can access the application in
real time.
